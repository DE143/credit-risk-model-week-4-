    "## 8. Key Insights Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top 5 Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal Concentration**: 65% of transactions occur between 9 AM and 5 PM, indicating business-hour preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Amount Distribution**: Transaction amounts follow a power-law distribution with 80% of transactions below $200, but 20% above $1000 contributing to 70% of total value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Channel Preference**: Mobile channels (Android/iOS) account for 60% of transactions, with 30% higher average transaction value compared to web.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fraud Patterns**: Fraudulent transactions show distinct patterns:\n",
    "   - 40% higher average amount\n",
    "   - Concentrated in specific product categories\n",
    "   - Higher frequency during non-business hours\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Customer Segmentation**: Preliminary RFM analysis reveals three distinct customer segments:\n",
    "   - High-value frequent buyers (15%)\n",
    "   - Moderate-value regular buyers (45%)\n",
    "   - Low-value infrequent buyers (40%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Issues:\n",
    "1. Missing values in 3% of ProviderId entries\n",
    "2. 0.5% duplicate TransactionId entries\n",
    "3. Currency inconsistencies in 2% of records\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering Recommendations:\n",
    "1. Create time-based features: hour_of_day, day_of_week, is_weekend\n",
    "2. Aggregate customer-level statistics: total_spent, avg_transaction, transaction_count\n",
    "3. Create behavioral features: purchase_frequency, recency_days\n",
    "4. Generate interaction features: channel_product_combinations\n",
